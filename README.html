<h1 id="project1description">Project 1 description</h1>

<p>The project contains 3 html files for authorization and 3 other html files for when a user is logged in. 2 layouts.html are used to separate the css for auth section of website and logged in section. The application.py contains 7 def/routes, register is rendered in auth/register.html which on success returns user to auth/login.html with success message stating registration was successful and they can login. The login route accepts user credentials and on success user is redirected to index where app checks if the user is in the session, index holds all the search logic which is then rendered in index.html. Once a user runs a search the results will show on a table with links to book route, which renders in book.html and shows all the details of the book. The other button is the isbn which takes user to api/<isbn> to view data in json. The review def/route checks for a post method and collects the reviewed data using request.form.get which then checks all data matches the requirements before it executes to the database. The logout def uses pop to empty the session and redirect the user to the login page. The import.py uses psycopg2 to connect to the database, where I then open a cursor to perform database operations execute and commit. the upload time was about 5&#8211;10min. </p>
